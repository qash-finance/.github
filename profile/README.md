## What is Qash?

Qash is a **private neobank for global teams**, primarily targeting **SEA, LATAM, and Africa**. It enables companies to **pay, earn, and spend** across chains and currencies without exposing sensitive financial data.

## The Problems We Solve

- **Treasury transparency** – On-chain payments, yielding and spending reveal who was paid, how much, and when, forcing some teams to rely on centralized exchanges to cut tracability.
- **Operational friction** – Managing multiple wallets, spreadsheets, and tools (Safe + Excel + CEX) is slow and error-prone.

## How Qash Helps

- **Cross-chain private payouts** – Pay your team in any chain or currency without manual bridging.
- **Earn yield on idle funds** – Low-risk instruments for treasury optimization.
- **Simplified invoicing** – Send invoices and receive payments in crypto or fiat.
- **All-in-one platform** – Corporate credit cards, accounting, audit report, and integrations in one platform.
